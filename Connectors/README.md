# OpenFormicarium - Connectors

A Open Source modular ant aormicarium and home with simple space saving connectors.

## Available Connectors

### Main Connector 
This connector connects two modules together

### Connector blocker
Same formfactor as the Main connector but it blocks the path

### Tube Connectors for 10mm, 12mm and 14mm inner circumference
A variation of tube connectors. The test-/tubes go over the connector, not in.

IMPORTANT! Do not print this with PLA, use a flexible filament.


### Endcap if nothing gets attached to a connection endpoint
A bit nicer looking than a block connector but cannot be used to connect two modules
