# OpenFormicaria

A Open Source modular ant formicarium and home with simple space saving connectors.

## Features
Check the READMEs in the folders for more detailed information.
All modules are based on a 35mmx35mm base grid for ability to interconnect all of them (At least connector facing parts). 4xGateway is 35x35mm, 6xGateway is 35x70mm. All of the modules are 20mm high.

### Connector Version 2 (CV2) and Connector Version 1
There are two version available, both are similar in design with version 2 being improved. The only reason not to use CV2 is if you do not have any flexible filament, CV1 will work for you in that case.

With CV2 you can seemlessly switch connectors that are in use, for example allowing you to block passages between modules by switching out a Connector with a Blocker.

Note that all CV2 connectors **have** to be printed in TPU or any flexible material.

### Connectors
* Connector that connects two modules
* Connector that connects two modules but block the path
* Tube Connectors for 10mm, 12mm and 14mm inner circumference
* Connnector Raiser
* Separator (CV2 Only)
* Endcap if nothing gets attached to a connection endpoint
  * A bit nicer looking than a block connector but cannot be used to connect two modules

#### Connector Roadmap
* Angle connectors (90Â°)

### Modules (Both availabe in CV1 and CV2 versions)
* Portal - Module with feeding and air ports, first small outworld with 4 connection ports
* 4xGateway - A small 4x connection port gateway
* 6xGateway - More space or broader attachement to other modules!

### Formicarium (Both availabe in CV1 and CV2 versions)
* Formicarium Size S and M Template
  * Lasius style interior

#### Formicarium Roadmap
* Size L, maybe XL?
* More interior

## Printing recommendation
* Use PLA or other mold resistant material for modules and formicaria
* TPU or similar flex material is recommended for Connectors in general.
  * Tube connectors that attach to test tubes HAVE to be TPU (Maybe this can be improved?)
* CV2 Connectors have to be printed in TPU/Flex
* 0.2mm layer hight is sufficient for all files
* 15% infill is sufficient
* When printing a formicarium, I do recommend using a glue stick where the holes will be printed to make sure it those stick cleanly.

## Starting Out

### A initial home

If you have a test tube setup and you think your ants are ready for their first scavenging outside of it but still to small for a proper outworld, you can use a Portal! This allows you to connect several other modules and connectors to it.

Here is a list of the Items you should print for a base kit with a Portal. Once you have that, you can expand as needed!
Note that I do recommend printing all CV2 if you have a flexible filament available.

#### The Base Kit
* 1x Portal
  * 2x Portal Feeder Lids
  * 1x Portal Lid
* 2x Separators (CV2 Only)
* 3x Endpoint Blocker
* 1x Tube connector fitting your test tube size
