## Printing recommendation
* Use PLA or other mold resistant material for modules and formicaria
* TPU or similar flex material is recommended for Connectors.
  * Tube connectors that attach to test tubes HAVE to be TPU (Maybe this can be improved?)
* 0.2mm layer hight is sufficient for all files
* 15% infill is sufficient
