# Getting Started

## A initial home

If you have a test tube setup and you think your ants are ready for their first scavenging outside of it but still to small for a proper outworld, you can use a Portal! This allows you to connect several other modules and connectors to it.

Here is a list of the Items you should print for a base kit with a Portal. Once you have that, you can expand as needed!
Note that I do recommend printing all CV2 if you have a flexible filament available.

### The Base Kit
* 1x Portal
  * 2x Portal Feeder Lids
  * 1x Portal Lid
* 2x Separators (CV2 Only)
* 3x Endpoint Blocker
* 1x Tube connector fitting your test tube size
