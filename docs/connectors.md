# OpenFormicaria - Connectors

A Open Source modular ant aormicarium and home with simple space saving connectors.

## Available Connectors
Check in the respective folders for CV1 or CV2 connectors. Note that CV2 connectors have to be printed with a flexible filament!

## Main Connector 
This connector connects two modules together

## Connector blocker
Same formfactor as the Main connector but it blocks the path

## Tube Connectors for 10mm, 12mm and 14mm inner circumference
A variation of tube connectors. The test-/tubes go over the connector, not in.

IMPORTANT! Do not print this with PLA, use a flexible filament.

## Tube Connectors on an 90Â° angle for 10mm, 12mm and 14mm inner circumference
A variation of tube connectors. The test-/tubes go over the connector, not in.

IMPORTANT! Do not print this with PLA, use a flexible filament.

## Endcap if nothing gets attached to a connection endpoint
A bit nicer looking than a block connector but cannot be used to connect two modules

## Connector Raiser 
This connector allows you to connect a modules like a Portal to a formicarium which is higher above due the basin. Now there is no more floating modules.

## Separator (CV2 only)
This "connector" allows you to separate two connected modules and block both entries. I recommend to print at least a pair of those for your setup.
