# Available Parts

## Connector Version 2 (CV2) and Connector Version 1
There are two version available, both are similar in design with version 2 being improved. The only reason not to use CV2 is if you do not have any flexible filament, CV1 will work for you in that case.

With CV2 you can seemlessly switch connectors that are in use, for example allowing you to block passages between modules by switching out a Connector with a Blocker.

Note that all CV2 connectors **have** to be printed in TPU or any flexible material.
