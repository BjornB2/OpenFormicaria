Features overview OpenFormicaria is a set of parts that interconnect expand upon another. Any part is compatible with any other part ranging from the small Portal where you can found your colony after the test tube up to interconnecting many formicaria. All modules are based on a 35mmx35mm base grid for ability to interconnect all of them (At least connector facing parts). 4xGateway is 35x35mm, 6xGateway is 35x70mm. All of the modules are 20mm high. A variety of connectors to connect modules, formicaria, tubes etc. Connectors can be exchanged safely while the part is in use to prevent ant escapees. Different sizes of formicaria for different colony sizes Different formicaria insert styles for different ant races Easy way to create your own custom insert! Portal module with feeding access for a first small outworld to explore and expand 4x or 6x Gateway modules to expand the farm Reading On Check out what kind of parts OF has available.

How to PR/MR on Github When you have a creation you want to have added, make sure it is in the correct folder (STL exports, CAD files etc.). Add the documentation of your part in to docs folder as well. Please create PRs into the devel branch! Base structural blocks for any modules A base block has the size of 35mmx35mmx20mm . The 4xGateway has essentially those measurments. This square is essentially the base block size for connenctor facing faces. You can see this with the the 6xGateway. On a side, they have two connector placements, this side has to be 70mm wide to fit both of them. A face that does not intend to have connectors, you are free to move out of this size. The example here would be the Portal. The face with the feeder holes is a bit outside of this box. Some other specs to modules The glass cut out is 3mm deep The m3 screw holes have a radius of 1.4mm The ant \"cutout\" is recommended to be around 15mm deep. This leads to have a 2mm floor with 20mm total height. To hold the glass I've used a 1mm wide ledge sofar Connector Please have a look at the folder Measurements with all the detailing measurements on how the connector looks like. A connector is set up with the following parts: Female Connector is on all Modules. Be aware in the difference of CV1 and CV2. Have a look at the image Connector Cut Measurements . The hole cut through has a radius of 5mm and is centered. CV2 Female has a Hill that is in the center.

Check out the images ConnectorV2_Rail and \" ConnectorV2_Groove for the specs Formicaria The formicaria are created in two steps: 1) A template is created and maintained for each size. This template is empty and does not have any ant digging site, just free space. This gets exported as STL. 2) In Photoshop or any editor of your preference a black/white plan of the ant pathways is drawn. This then get imported in 3D Builder and placed into the template, combining the two. This approach allows to create many different inserts for the formicaria for different ant species. You can of course further customize the templates if you wish.

You can find the files in the corresponding STL folders Required Materials You will need any hard filament (PLA, PETG) for CV1. If you want to use CV2 (which is recommended) you will need a flexible filament like TPU or Flex. Connector Version 2 (CV2) and Connector Version 1 (CV1) There are two version available, both are similar in design with version 2 being improved. The only reason not to use CV2 is if you do not have any flexible filament, CV1 will work for you in that case. With CV2 you can seemlessly switch connectors that are in use, for example allowing you to block passages between modules by switching out a Connector with a Blocker. Note that all CV2 connectors have to be printed in TPU or any flexible material. Set suggestions and Ideas The Base Kit - A initial home If you have a test tube setup and you think your ants are ready for their first scavenging outside of it but still to small for a proper outworld, you can use a Portal! This allows you to connect several other modules and connectors to it. Here is a list of the items you should print for a base kit with a Portal. Once you have that, you can expand as needed! Note that I do recommend printing all CV2 if you have a flexible filament available. The Base Kit 1x Portal 2x Portal Feeder Lids 1x Portal Lid 2x Separators (CV2 Only) 3x Endpoint Blocker 2x Tube connector fitting your test tube size The second tube connector can be used to add water or lead to a proper outworld A first Formicarium - Expanding your colony Once the colony has outgrown the test tube setup and needs a proper nest you can start with a S sized nest that fits your colony! You can connect your Formicarium directly to the portal or use tubing to connect to it. Generally, I recommend printing the base kit anyway and expand from there.
